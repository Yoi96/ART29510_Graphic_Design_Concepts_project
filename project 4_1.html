		<h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>ðŸŽ® Play game</li>
			<li>ðŸŽ§ Listening pop music</li>
			<li>ðŸŽ¬ Watching drama</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>LikesðŸ¥° & Dislike ðŸ˜’</h2>
		 <p>I like to play games, but I don't like to play music games. For example,
		 "<span class="italicized">Magic tiles3</span> ",
		 "<span class="italicized">Dancing Road: Color Ball Run!" </span>,
		 or "<span class="italicized"> Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!</span>.
		 In addition, I like to go shopping, but I don't like to go shopping online. I am taking the black and white film camera photography class this semester,
		 but I don't like to develop photos because the waiting time is too long, unlike digital cameras, where you can take pictures immediately and see the results.
		 I like puppies and cats, but I don't have the ability to keep pets, so I don't have pets. In addition, I like eat Chinese food, but I don't like eat in New
		 York because eating Chinese food in New York is sweet than eating chinese food in China and unauthentic. </p>

		<h2>Favorite foods </h2>
		<p>My favorite food is Contonese style Wonton Noodle Soup. Guangzhou city or Hongkong people also call "ç»†è“‰"(Xi Rong) means small size. When I was younger, I ate the traditional and authentic wonton
		noodles in my hometown.The chef was using pressed bamboo to make noodles. ï¼ˆFigure 1ï¼‰We call this noodles "ç«¹æ˜‡éºµ"(Jook-sing noodles). Due to the development of technology, many shops only use machines
		to make noodles. Therefore, it is difficult to eat traditional Cantonese-style wonton noodles in Guangdong province.</p>
