  <h2>LikesðŸ¥° & Dislike ðŸ˜’</h2>
  I like to play games, but I don't like to play music games. For example, games like 'Magic Tiles 3,' 'Dancing Road: Color Ball Run!' or 'Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!' In addition, I enjoy going shopping, but I don't like shopping online. I'm taking a black and white film camera photography class this semester, but I don't enjoy developing photos because the waiting time is too long. Unlike digital cameras, where you can take pictures immediately and see the results. I love puppies and cats, but I don't have the ability to keep pets, so I don't have any. Furthermore, I enjoy eating Chinese food, but I don't like eating it in New York because the Chinese food in New York is sweeter than the authentic Chinese food in China.

	<h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
	My favorite food is Contonese style Wonton Noodle Soup. Guangzhou city or Hongkong people also call "ç»†è“‰"(Xi Rong) means small size. When I was younger, I ate the traditional and authentic wonton noodles in my hometown.The chef was using pressed bamboo to make noodles. ï¼ˆFigure 1ï¼‰We call this noodles "ç«¹æ˜‡éºµ"(Jook-sing noodles). Due to the development of technology, many shops only use machines to make noodles. Therefore, it is difficult to eat traditional Cantonese-style wonton noodles in Guangdong province.
